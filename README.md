# Linux File Management System


## Introduction:
This project involved working with Ubuntu on Linux.  One of my hobbies is teaching English to people from other countries, and I wanted to use Linux in a scenario related to teaching English.  

If I worked with a group of fellow English teachers, for example, who all wanted to access English teaching materials on my Linux server, I would need a solution to allow all of them to browse, search, and download the contents of my workstation from their own different physical locations through a virtual private network.  The current scope of this project was to set it up with my local computer as the host.  Future improvements would include setting up the VPN to actually make it accessible from other computers.  

I used Apache as the local web server. I installed Recoll, a free file management system which works on Linux, as an alternative to the native Nautilus file management system on Unbutu.  Recoll has the ability to index files and allows my team to search for files by type, such as “*pdf” through a Web UI.   

I used VMWare to install and run Linux on a virtual machine loaded on my personal Macbook to isolate it from the rest of my work.  

When looking at VMWare’s website, I noticed that there is WMWare Workstation and VMWare Fusion.  I did some Googling to determine the difference between Workstation and Fusion, and discovered that Workstation is for Windows, while Fusion is for Mac.  Since have a Mac, I installed Fusion.  

This document serves as a manual that others can use to accomplish the same thing, should they wish to do so.
